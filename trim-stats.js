/**
 * Lightweight registry that tracks per-tier trim statistics.
 *
 * Each inject function reports its full content size and its injected size.
 * The token bar reads these stats to show a visual indicator when a tier is
 * actively dropping content to stay within budget.
 *
 * In group chats multiple characters inject per round, each overwriting the
 * current stats for their tiers. Auto-tune must size budgets for the greediest
 * character seen across the session, not just the last one to inject. The high
 * water mark (_hwStats) tracks the maximum `full` demand per tier since the
 * last chat change - auto-tune reads from there, the token bar reads _stats.
 *
 * reportTierTrimStats    - records injected vs full token counts for a tier
 * getTierTrimStats       - returns the stored stats for a tier key
 * getTierHWStats         - returns the high water mark stats for a tier key
 * clearTierTrimStats     - resets all stats and HWM (call on chat change)
 * clearTierStats         - clears recent-injection stats for one tier (keeps HWM)
 * hasAnyTrimmedTier      - returns true when at least one non-exempt tier is over budget
 * markTrimToastFired     - records that the one-time trim toast has been shown
 * hasTrimToastFired      - returns true if the toast has already been shown
 * resetTrimToastFlag     - clears toast + load-complete flags (call on chat change)
 * markChatLoadComplete   - signals that the initial chat load injection pass is done
 * isChatLoadComplete     - returns true once the load pass has finished
